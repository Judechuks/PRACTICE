        Few things have been more beautiful than my note book on the Deist
        Controversy as it fell downward through the waters of the
        Mediterranean. It dived, like a piece of black slate, but opened soon,
        disclosing leaves of pale green, which quivered into blue. Now it had
        vanished, now it was a piece of magical india rubber stretching out to
        infinity, now it was a book again, but bigger than the book of all
        knowledge. It grew more fantastic as it reached the bottom, where a
        puff of sand welcomed it and obscured it from view. But it
        reappeared, quite sane though a little tremulous, lying decently open
        on its back, while unseen fingers fidgeted among its leaves.
        "It is such a pity" said my aunt, "that you will not finish your work in
        the Hotel. Then you would be free to enjoy yourself and this would
        never have happened."
        "Nothing of it but will change into something rich and strange,"
        warbled the chaplain, while his sister said "Why it's gone into the
        water." As for the boatmen, one of them laughed, while the other,
        without a word of warning, stood up and began to take his clothes off.
        "Holy Moses!" cried the Colonel. "Is the fellow mad?"
        "Yes, thank him dear," said my aunt: "that is to say tell him he is very
        kind, but perhaps another time."

    <p><a href="#back-to-2">The Witch's Tower</a><a name="tower"></a><br>
        Gothel’s choice is simple: either stand guard over Princess Rapunzel—or die. But just because a
        choice is easy doesn’t mean it’s pleasant. Protecting Rapunzel means watching her lay trapped in a tower,
        bedridden by hair that is so long and heavy it’s driving her insane. Gothel’s life has become one of
        imprisonment and solitude, too—until a prince and his handsome squire appear at the tower…

        SUPPOSING that Truth is a woman—what then? Is there not ground for
        suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists, have
        failed to understand women—that the terrible seriousness and clumsy
        importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to Truth, have
        been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman? Certainly she has
        never allowed herself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with
        sad and discouraged mien—IF, indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who
        maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground—nay more, that it is
        at its last gasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all
        dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided
        airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism; and
        probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood WHAT
        has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical
        edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular
        superstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition, which, in the
        form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief):

    <p><a href="#back-to-4">How to Use your Mind</a><a name="mind"></a><br>
        Educational leaders are seeing with increasing clearness the necessity of
        teaching students not only the subject-matter of study but also methods of study.
        Teachers are beginning to see that students waste a vast amount of time and form
        many harmful habits because they do not know how to use their minds. The
        recognition of this condition is taking the form of the movement toward
        "supervised study," which attempts to acquaint the student with principles of
        economy and directness in using his mind. It is generally agreed that there are
        certain "tricks" which make for mental efficiency, consisting of methods of
        apperceiving facts, methods of review, devices for arranging work. Some are the
        fruits of psychological experimentation; others are derived from experience.
        Many of them can be imparted by instruction, and it is for the purpose of
        systematizing these and making them available for students that this book is
        prepared.
