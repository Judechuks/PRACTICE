<h1>The wbr element</h1>

<p>Try to shrink the browser window, to view how the very long word in 
the paragraph below will break:</p>

<p>This is a veryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryvery<wbr>longwordthatwillbreakatspecific<wbr>placeswhenthebrowserwindowisresized.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The wbr element is not supported in Internet Explorer 11 (or earlier).</p> <br> <br> <br>
<p>To learn AJAX, you must be familiar with the XML<wbr>Http<wbr>Request Object.</p>

<!-- 
  The <wbr> (Word Break Opportunity) tag specifies where in a text it would be ok to add a line-break.

Tip: When a word is too long, the browser might break it at the wrong place. You can use the <wbr> element to add word break opportunities.
